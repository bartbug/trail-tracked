After sleeping in, making a last stop at REI for things that we couldn’t bring on the plane, and taking an hour and a half Uber, we arrived at the Amicalola falls visitor center at around 2:30 PM. Registering for the trail took around an hour, and so we got going right before 4. One fun thing is that we’re not actually on the trail yet; this is the approach to the Appalachian trail, not the trail itself. The approach starts with 500 stairs to see a really stunning waterfall. This absolutely obliterated my calves, so between that and the late start, we camped pretty early, happy to be on the trail at all. Well. Kinda. We’re still on the approach!
