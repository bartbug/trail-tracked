We woke up to the rain, we lifted our tent up to the shelter and took it down under the roof so the inside stayed dry.

Town was great. I had a beer and burg at the brewery, we resulted, and Katie spent two hours getting a shoe that fits and doesn’t bruise. Can’t ask for anything more! The campsite has a trash can, so we brought back heavy food and drinks for dinner. Treat yoself.

The best part of this was that we were able to provide a bit of trail magic for the incoming hikers. I traded beers with a dude named Ketchup, who in return played his banjo. His banjo is a really cool instrument he designed to break into pieces so he could take it backpacking. He was great, and music by the fire really hit the spot.

We forgot our poles in town, but luckily, we have some buddies who were staying overnight and are able to bring them to the trailhead in the morning.

We also got (tentative) trail names! Introducing, Something Bangable, Something for short, and Firehole! I’m Something Bangable, and Katie is Firehole. I’m Something Bangable because Katie was talking about bears with some of the other hikers, and she mentioned that she wished she kept “something bangable” in the tent that she could use to scare the bears away. When she said that, everyone looked at me as if to say, “don’t you already have something”? And she’s Firehole cus she got too close to the fire and burned a whole in her pants, and Firehole sounds dirty, which everyone loves.
