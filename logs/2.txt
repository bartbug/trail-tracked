We pulled a long one to make up some distance from a short first day (Someone said that his calves were shot and he couldnâ€™t go a single step further). Today we officially began the Appalachian Trail! We ate lemon pepper tuna and ramen for dinner, truly an exquisite culinary masterpiece. Amazing. Iconic.
