Holy schnikeys today was unfun. We woke up to the inspiring sound of rain. We hoped we could wait it out. We could not. When we started, a ranger recommended that we do 8 mile days for the first week. Scoffing at that advice, we did 13.5 yesterday. Today we did  8.  It felt like a really good idea for some reason. To dry out a bit from the rain, we’re staying in a shelter tonight. It’s basically a two story open face wood cabin, where hikers can fill up both floors with their sleeping set ups. There’s a dozen or so other thru hikers here, so we’re enjoying the camaraderie and the roof. Sure, there’s a risk of norovirus, but I can’t see norovirus and I can see rain.
