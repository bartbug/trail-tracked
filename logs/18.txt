Today was terrific! We had a good 5 mile hike into town, with a brief but invigorating climb and then a lot of downhill. First, we stopped at the marina to enjoy a soda and chips while waiting for a shuttle. Then we got pizza and resupplied in town at the upsettingly expensive general store. Good food but expensive. Oof. Then, we shuttled back and walked the last mile to the “Hilton”.

The Hilton is just a shelter, but also oh so much more. It’s got warm showers, ample space, and a huge fire pit overlooking the lake. And since the shuttle took us so close, we were able to bring drinks and pizza for dinner that night. A bunch of hikers did the same, and it was a good time. Katie jumped in the lake! The German led us in a very cool German folk song while Ketchup played banjo over it. Campfire songs and good food, what else can you ask for?
