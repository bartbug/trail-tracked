We summited Blood Mountain! It was honestly not too bad going up, but going down was a gnarly mix of streams freshly forged by the storm and rocky descents. It took a while and was pretty hard on the bones. And I may have taken us down a wrong turn for a fun ten minute detour. In my defense, branches strewn across the path made the path and the not path look pretty similar. We had a frozen pizza at Neil’s gap, and I acquired a pillow and sent home the Jet-Boil and my flip flops. I am now in search of the perfect pair of crocs for my next camp shoes. We did another 8 miles and then crashed at an impromptu campsite just out of site of a road. Rain looks like it might give us a break for a while, but wind has decided it’s here to stay.  35 mph gusts rocked us to sleep all night.
