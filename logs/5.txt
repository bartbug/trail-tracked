We woke up to some truly delicious smells and enjoyed breakfast at the hostel. Heeding the forecast, we waited until around 11AM to leave so that the last of the rain would be behind us. Unfortunately, the forecast lied. It continued to rain all day today so we tucked into the last shelter for quite some ways. Fortunately, we had dry clothes to change into, and all of our sleeping equipment is dry. Tomorrow we have a big day ahead of us. 16 miles and Blood Mountain, here we come!
