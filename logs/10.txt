Green Dragon Hostel sent us on our way with bellies full of delicious French toast, and we got hiking promptly at around 8:30 AM. The first half of today was your standard up and down, with some climbs being a bit annoying, if only because the progress was immediately erased by a descent. The second half started with a long continual climb, and then something amazing happened: we crossed the North Carolina border. WE DID IT! Georgia can eat my shorts. One state down, forty-nine to go (I’m pretty sure that’s right). North Carolina welcomed us with three back to back BRUTAL climbs. I’m sore. I hurt. Great first impression, NC.
