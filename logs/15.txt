We arrived at the NOC. We climbed down nearly three thousand feet, and when we leave, weâ€™ll have to climb right back up. The NOC is a sports center with white water rafting and zip-lining and the like. Most importantly, it has a restaurant and accommodations. The day was 16.5 miles, and we were very tired by the end, but we appreciated the restaurant, the beds, the warmth, and most of all, the shower. The next morning, we were contemplating a zero,  but our fate was sealed by the luxury of basking in the sun by the river while nursing a cold drink. We saw tons of trail friends here and hung out with them for dinner and at a cabin after. Truly a great time, and not too expensive!
