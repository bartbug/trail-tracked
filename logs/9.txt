Today was awesome because we wimped out HARD. We did a 17 mile today. It had 60% more climbing than our next most vertical day. We did it faster than average. How was this feat accomplished?

Slackpacking.

With slackpacking, you leave your stuff at an accommodating hostel, and are shuttled to do a section while carrying only what you need for a day. You hike, and when finished, you are retrieved by a shuttle and finish the night at the hostel. In this case, all it cost was an extra night at the fabulous Green Dragon Hostel. It was absolutely wonderful. So, we did a huge day, get to finish it with a shower and a bed, and will manage to hit tomorrow somehow more refreshed! Very cash money.
