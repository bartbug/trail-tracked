After a long, 15 mile day of hiking, we arrived at our campsite. The day was good with good views and a cool old fire tire, but we are pooped. 
We did ANOTHER shelter. This time it rained at night and was brutally cold. The shelter ended up being full up; six of us with our sleeping pads touching wall to wall. We had a pretty view and ate some delicious ramen with hard boiled eggs and cream cheese donated by fellow hikers. The plan is to do 16 miles tomorrow to get to the NOC, since it’ll be colder than tonight and we’ll be able to get frugal bunks with a heater for the night.
