Another 12 mile day. Phew. Lots of little up and downs, on super rocky surfaces. It coulda been really beautiful, but I couldn’t tell ya, since all I saw was my feet. 

I kid, I kid. There was a stretch of flat walkway ringing around a little mountain that had a little waterfall to refill at every half mile or so. That was pretty sweet. We’ve been listening to the Wheel of Time, and it’s great fun to feel like we’re right there with Rand and Friends, hiking through the countryside evading Trollocs. And when we got to our shelter, it was full of familiar faces and we had plenty of time to hang out and get food ready. We had our first honest to goodness campfire! I didn’t get it started but I did gather the bulk of the wood and kept it going through the night. We fried up some spam, delicious, and Katie and I each had a ramen and tuna. We’re doing a hostel again tomorrow, as Katie has a small army of blisters and we’re hoping a day of mostly rest can give her a chance to heal those up a bit instead of continually tearing them open. Since we have a chance to resupply tomorrow, we feasted. Food, fire, what else can you ask for?
