We both took red eyes that had a layover in Charlotte, and then Katie and I were together for the second flight to Atlanta. We got a sweet room upgrade to the corner room at the top floor, with a killer view of the Fox Theater. I drank about a 100 different sodas at the Coca Cola museum. All in all, a good day.
