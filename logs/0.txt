cool log, I think that "this is awesome."
what do you think? 
I wish I was a fish because if I was a fish then I'd be able to swim underwater and eventually become sushi when I die. Since I'm not a fish instead of swimming I have to walk like a loser, and when I die I don't get to become such sushi at all.
Total.
Bummer.
Did you know?
Did you know that fish are the best proto birds ever?
That's right.
If we didn't have fish we would have never gotten to birds and you know what that means.
No fried chicken <strong> EITHER! </strong>
