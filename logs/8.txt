A quick three mile hike and we were whisked away to the lovely Green Dragon Hostel. Man, these hostels have rocked so far. Our hosts seem to truly love the trail and the hikers, and they go above and beyond for us. We were taken into Hiawassee where we feasted and resupplied. Hiawassee brewery was a particular delight. In general, this town is gorgeous. The green hills and ever present lakesâ€¦ a great place to lay back and let our blisters mend and muscles unwind.
