Last night, seeing that more inclement weather was on the forecast, we decided to book a room at the EXCELLENT Above the Clouds Hostel. They had a free pickup at Woody Gap, which was only a 5 mile hike from the shelter, and they’ll drop us off there tomorrow as if we never left the trail. This hostel is amazing. Reasonably priced resupply from a large pantry, laundry for filthy hiker threads, and best of all— a cold spring with water from the mountain creeks. I of course took a dip, and felt the respite from my aches for five chilling minutes. We dried our soaked gear, and our host, Lucky, went into town and picked up some delicious BBQ for everyone. It’ll be hard to go back to the trail digs after this rejuvenation, but this rest was also soooo welcome. We had good times with the other hikers, many of whom we’d met at the shelter last night, and enjoyed a wonderful slice of the AT experience.
