        <p>If you scroll left-right through the entry logs the map will pan to their

          My name is Christien. I'm hiking the Appalachian Trail and chronicling my journey here.
          As you can tell, web design is my p a s s i o n. After I've finished my hike, if someone 
          could hire me that'd be pretty sick ngl.

          Web development technology peaked with HTML. Don't @ me.
